URL: `https://jobs.saic.com/jobs/16697358-penetration-tester`

---

## Task 2: Understand job details and requirements

**Job Details (from the listing):**

- **Company Name:** SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation)  
- **Job Title:** Penetration Tester  
- **Location:** Remote (Tennessee, USA)  
- **Employment Type:** Full-time

---

## Task 3: Determine job attractiveness

**Attractive Aspects:**

- Remote option provides flexibility.  
- Broad technical scope (cloud, red teaming, forensics) allows development across multiple cybersecurity areas.  
- Competitive salary range for the experience level.  
- Working for a reputable contractor that often supports government and enterprise clients (valuable resume credentials).  
- Opportunity to build both technical and soft skills (reporting, client communication).

**Less Attractive / Challenging Aspects:**

- High experience expectation — not an entry‑level role.  
- Advanced topics (malware reverse engineering, cloud architecture) require significant upskilling.  
- Potential for high workload and stress in client-driven deliverables.

**Interest in Applying:**  
This is an excellent aspirational target for mid‑career. With current skills and planned development, a path to junior roles within 6–12 months and to roles like this in 18–36 months is feasible.

---

## Task 4: Identify gaps in your portfolio

**Profile used to assess gaps:**

- **Education:** Master’s degree in Emergency Management (2024).  
- **Certifications / Courses:** IBM *Intro to Cybersecurity Essentials*; IBM *Hands‑on Linux*; Google/Coursera security fundamentals; PACKT *Ethical Hacking Foundations*; University of Michigan *Python 3 Programming* (in progress).  
- **Skills / Tools / Experience:** Python, C++, Lua, PHP, HTML; Linux (Kali), Nmap, packet sniffers, Bash/PowerShell basics, virtualization, Git/GitHub, home lab with multiple VMs, server & network config experience (game servers, DBs).  
- **Hands‑On / CTF:** Active on TryHackMe and HTB; maintains a CTF journal; comfortable with pentest workflows and labs.  
- **Career Goal:** Penetration tester / red team operator.

**Gaps (prioritized):**

1. **Professional pentest certification(s)** — lacking a widely recognized, hands‑on penetration testing certification (e.g., PNPT, OSCP, Pentest+).  
2. **Documented real-world pentesting experience** — need client-style engagements and reports to demonstrate end‑to‑end assessment capability.  
3. **Intermediate/advanced adversary skills** — exploit chaining, authenticated testing, lateral movement, enterprise AD exploitation.  
4. **Cloud security pentesting exposure** — practical AWS/Azure/GCP pentesting experience.  
5. **Malware analysis / reverse engineering** — optional but often expected for advanced roles.  
6. **Polished technical reporting & stakeholder communication** — client-ready executive summaries and remediation plans.  
7. **Multi-year industry experience** — many mid-level roles require 3+ years; start with junior roles first.

---

## Task 5: Create a plan (Actionable roadmap)

### Overarching Goal
Target: **Junior Penetration Tester** within 6–12 months; **Mid-level Penetration Tester / Red Teamer** within 18–36 months.

### Phase 0 — Immediate (Weeks 0–4): Organize foundations
- Create a **Pentesting Portfolio** GitHub repo. Include CTF writeups, lab walkthroughs, scripts, and sanitized reports.  
- Polish LinkedIn and resume with measurable bullets and links to portfolio artifacts.  
- Choose the first hands‑on pentest certification to pursue (PNPT or OSCP recommended).

**Milestones:** Portfolio repo created; one polished CTF or lab writeup posted; resume updated.

---

### Phase 1 — Build employer-facing skills & credentials (Months 1–6)

**Certifications (priority order):**
1. CompTIA Security+ (optional if fundamentals need formal cert).  
2. Choose one high‑value practical cert: **PNPT** _or_ **OSCP** _or_ **CompTIA Pentest+**.  
   - **PNPT** — strong focus on practical pentesting workflow and reporting (employer-friendly).  
   - **OSCP** — highly technical and respected for exploit capability.  
   - **Pentest+** — broader vendor-agnostic certification, less time-consuming.

**Skills & Projects:**
- Finish Python specialization; create 3 automation scripts for pentest tasks (port scanner wrapper, basic vuln scanner automation, authenticated web fuzzing helper). Publish on GitHub.  
- Complete and document at least 10 medium-difficulty TryHackMe/HTB boxes — create professional-style pentest reports for each (technical + executive summary). Sanitize and add to your portfolio.  
- Build a cloud pentest lab (AWS/Azure free tier); deploy a vulnerable app and perform a self-assessment; document findings and remediation.  
- Set up a Windows AD lab and practice AD attack techniques (Kerberoasting, pass-the-hash, lateral movement).

**Milestones:** Practical pentest cert scheduled; 5–10 lab writeups uploaded; cloud pentest lab documented.

---

### Phase 2 — Gain real-world experience (Months 6–12)

**Experience avenues (pick 2–3):**
- Apply for Junior Penetration Tester, Security Analyst, or pentest internships.  
- Do bug bounties and responsibly disclose findings (start with low-severity programs to learn triage).  
- Volunteer pentesting engagements for nonprofits or small businesses (with written permission and scope).  
- Freelance pentesting gigs (contract-based, with explicit legal scope).

**Portfolio & Skills:**
- Produce 3 client-ready pentest reports (web app, internal network, cloud misconfiguration).  
- Strengthen post-exploitation and scripting skills (PowerShell, Python).  
- Choose a specialty: web app, cloud, or AD/enterprise pentesting and build depth.

**Milestones:** First paid/real engagement; 3 polished client reports; PNPT/OSCP completed.

---

### Phase 3 — Mid-level progression (Months 12–36)

- Accumulate 1–3 years of pentesting experience; mentor juniors and lead engagements.  
- Pursue advanced or specialized certifications: CREST, OSCE, GIAC certs (GWAPT/GRE), or cloud-specific security certs if specializing.  
- Learn malware analysis/reverse engineering if targeting roles requiring it (GREM or similar).  
- Apply to mid-level roles (Senior Penetration Tester, Red Team Operator).

**Milestones:** 2+ years experience or equivalent portfolio; advanced certs; applying to mid-level roles.

## Practical Portfolio Items to Build (immediately)

1. **CTF/HTB writeups repo** — 8–12 detailed writeups (commands, PoC, remediation).  
2. **Three client-style pentest reports** — one web app, one internal network, one cloud assessment.  
3. **Automation scripts** — short Python tools with README and usage examples.  
4. **Blog / GitHub Pages** — publish 2–3 long-form writeups.  
5. **Resume + LinkedIn** — tailored to pentesting (include links to portfolio artifacts).
